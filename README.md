# Simple Event

This is a simple Ethereum Smart Contract allowing which represents an event, owned by an organiser.

The event is initialized with a number of tickets and price of tickets.

Tickets can be purchased for ether, and the total balance of the event can be withdrawn by the owner.

Future work:

* Fully test
* Cancel event, refund
* Add name, description
* Add venue, time
* Verify tickets upon arrival
* Tickets are their own contract?
* Withdrawal based on either: time or unique ticket contract confirmation?

* Build easy dapp on top, so multiple events can be managed, tickets can be bought, etc
